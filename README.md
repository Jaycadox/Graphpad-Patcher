# GraphPad Prism 10.0.2 (232) patcher/crack
## Crack instructions
1. Run `Graphpad-Patcher.exe` either before GraphPad is open, or during. `Graphpad-Patcher.exe` will automatically open GraphPad if it's not running.
2. Given the patching was successful. Click `Serial Number (Machine Licenses)` in the Activation modal.
3. You can then type anything in the `Serial number` input, but there is a character limit before you can click `Next Step`.
4. Ignore the `Machine ID` screen, and just click `Enter activation code`
5. Type anything into the `Activation code` input. (**Note: you must fill the box with characters until it almost reaches the `Paste` button, else the program will crash**). Agree to the terms then click `Start using Prism`
6. You will then be prompted to type a `First name`, `Last name`, and `Email`. You need to fill these inputs but you can use garbage data and click `OK`.
7. You'll then get an error saying there is a connectivity issue, click `Continue`
8. Enjoy :D

## Notes
* You should be able to keep your internet on the entire time.
* This is a pretty shitty crack, GraphPad still phones home but client side checks are bypassed. There also might be hidden crack traps which aren't bypassed.
